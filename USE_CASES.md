# Messaging & Real-time Architecture Use Cases

## Overview

This document outlines practical use cases for **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, **Redis**, and **SignalR** in our real-time task management system, with emphasis on long-running processes and safe event handling.

---

## Use Case 1: Real-time Task Updates (SignalR + Redis)

### Scenario
When a task is updated, all connected users viewing that task should see changes instantly.

### Architecture
```
User A Updates Task → API → Database → SignalR Hub → Connected Clients
                       ↓
                    Redis Cache (Invalidation)
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **SignalR**: Push real-time updates to connected browsers
- **Redis**:
  - Backplane for SignalR in multi-server scenarios
  - Cache task data for quick retrieval
  - Store connection mapping (userId → connectionId)

### Code Flow
```csharp
// When task is updated
1. Save to Database
2. Invalidate Redis cache for task:{taskId}
3. Publish to SignalR Hub
4. SignalR pushes to all clients in task:{taskId} group
```

## Use Case 2: Long-running Task Processing (Kafka + Background Workers)

### Scenario
Bulk operations like "Archive all completed tasks from last year" or "Generate team productivity report" take too long for synchronous HTTP requests.

### Architecture
```
API Request → Kafka Topic (bulk-operations) → Consumer Workers → Process in Background
                                                    ↓
                                              SignalR Progress Updates
                                                    ↓
                                              Redis (Job Status)
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **Kafka**: Queue long-running jobs
  - Topic: `bulk-operations`
  - Partitioned by `tenantId` for parallelism
  - Maintains order within partition
  - Replayable (can reprocess from offset)

- **Redis**: Track job status and progress
  - Key: `job:{jobId}:status` → "pending|processing|completed|failed"
  - Key: `job:{jobId}:progress` → percentage
  - TTL: Auto-expire after 24 hours

- **SignalR**: Real-time progress updates to user

### Example Jobs
1. **Bulk Task Import** (CSV with 10,000 tasks)
2. **Report Generation** (Quarterly team analytics)
3. **Task Cleanup** (Archive tasks older than 1 year)
4. **Batch Notifications** (Send reminders to 1,000+ users)

---

## Use Case 3: Reliable Event-Driven Communication (RabbitMQ)

### Scenario
Critical business events that must be processed reliably, even if consumers are temporarily down.

### Architecture
```
Task Created Event → RabbitMQ Exchange → Multiple Queues
                                            ↓
                        [Notifications] [Analytics] [Audit Log] [Email]
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **RabbitMQ**: Reliable message delivery with acknowledgments
  - Exchange: `task.events` (fanout or topic)
  - Queues:
    - `task.notifications` → Send in-app notifications
    - `task.analytics` → Update analytics dashboard
    - `task.audit` → Audit logging
    - `task.email` → Email notifications
  - Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for failed messages
  - Message persistence for durability

### Critical Events
1. **Task Assignment** → Notify user, log, analytics
2. **Comment Added** → Notify mentioned users, audit trail
3. **Deadline Approaching** → Schedule reminders
4. **Task Completed** → Update team metrics, notifications

### Safety Features
- **Acknowledgments**: Message only removed after successful processing
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed processing
- **DLQ**: Failed messages go to dead letter queue for analysis
- **Idempotency**: Handle duplicate messages safely

---

## Use Case 4: Event Streaming & Analytics (Kafka)

### Scenario
Track all user actions for analytics, audit trails, and ML training data.

### Architecture
```
User Actions → Kafka Topic (user-activity-stream)
                    ↓
        [Real-time Analytics] [Data Lake] [ML Pipeline]
```

### Implementation Strategy
- **Kafka**: Event stream storage
  - Topic: `user-activity-stream`
  - Retention: 7 days
  - Partitioned by `userId`
  - Schema versioning with headers

### Events to Track
- Task views, edits, completions
- Search queries and filters
- Navigation patterns
- Feature usage
- Performance metrics

### Consumers
1. **Real-time Dashboard**: Show live user activity
2. **Data Warehouse**: Stream to analytics platform
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect suspicious patterns
4. **Feature Flags**: Adaptive UI based on behavior

---

## Use Case 5: Hybrid Messaging (Kafka + RabbitMQ + SignalR)

### Scenario
Complex workflow: User creates 100 tasks in bulk, each task triggers multiple side effects.

### Flow
```
1. API: Create Bulk Tasks Request
   ↓
2. Kafka: bulk-task-creation topic
   {jobId, userId, tasks[]}
   ↓
3. Worker: Process tasks in batches
   - Save to database
   - For each task created:
     ↓
4. RabbitMQ: task.created event
   {taskId, assignedTo, createdBy}
   ↓
5. Multiple Consumers:
   - Notification Service → Create notifications
   - Email Service → Send emails
   - Analytics Service → Update metrics
   - SignalR Service → Push to connected clients
   ↓
6. SignalR: Real-time updates to browser
   ↓
7. Redis: Cache new tasks, update job progress
```

### Why This Combination?

**Kafka** (Step 2-3):
- Handle high-volume bulk operation
- Replayable if worker crashes
- Horizontal scaling of workers

**RabbitMQ** (Step 4-5):
- Guaranteed delivery of critical events
- Fan-out to multiple consumers
- Dead letter queue for failures

**SignalR** (Step 6):
- Instant UI updates
- Progress bar for bulk operation

**Redis** (Step 7):
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Store job status
- SignalR backplane

## Use Case 6: Task Comments with Mentions (RabbitMQ + SignalR + Redis)

### Scenario
User adds comment with @mentions. Mentioned users need instant notifications.

### Architecture
```
POST /tasks/{id}/comments
    ↓
Save Comment to Database
    ↓
Publish to RabbitMQ: comment.created
    ↓
    ├─→ Notification Consumer
    │   ├─ Extract @mentions
    │   ├─ Create notifications in DB
    │   ├─ Cache in Redis: notifications:{userId}
    │   └─ Publish to SignalR → Browser notification
    │
    ├─→ Email Consumer
    │   └─ Send email to mentioned users
    │
    └─→ Analytics Consumer
        └─ Track engagement metrics
```

### Redis Usage
- Cache: `notifications:{userId}` → List of recent notifications
- Pub/Sub: `notifications:{userId}` → Trigger SignalR push
- Set: `online-users` → Track who's connected

---

## Use Case 7: Scheduled Task Reminders (Redis + RabbitMQ)

### Scenario
Check every minute for tasks with approaching deadlines and send reminders.

### Architecture
```
Background Job (every 1 minute)
    ↓
Check Redis Sorted Set: tasks-by-deadline
    ↓
Get tasks with deadline in next 24 hours
    ↓
For each task → Publish to RabbitMQ: task.reminder
    ↓
Consumers:
    ├─→ Email Service
    ├─→ Notification Service → SignalR
    └─→ SMS Service (if critical)
```

### Redis Sorted Set
```
Key: tasks-by-deadline
Score: Unix timestamp of deadline
Member: taskId

ZADD tasks-by-deadline {timestamp} {taskId}
ZRANGEBYSCORE tasks-by-deadline {now} {now+24h}
```

---

## Use Case 8: Caching Strategy with Redis

### Cache Keys Structure
```
task:{taskId}                     → Task object, TTL 1 hour
tasks:user:{userId}               → User's tasks, TTL 5 min
tasks:team:{teamId}               → Team tasks, TTL 5 min
user:{userId}:profile             → User profile, TTL 1 hour
notifications:{userId}            → Recent notifications, TTL 10 min
session:{sessionId}               → User session, TTL 30 min
search:results:{hash}             → Search results, TTL 2 min
```

### Cache Invalidation Patterns
1. **Write-through**: Update cache when updating DB
2. **Cache-aside**: Invalidate on write, populate on read
3. **Time-based**: TTL for auto-expiration
4. **Event-based**: Listen to RabbitMQ events to invalidate

---

## Use Case 9: Graceful Degradation

### Scenario
What happens when Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis are temporarily unavailable?

### Fallback Strategy

**If Redis is down:**
- Skip caching, query DB directly
- Disable SignalR backplane (single-server mode)
- Log warning but continue serving requests

**If Kafka is down:**
- Queue messages in memory buffer (limited size)
- Fallback to RabbitMQ for critical events
- Disable analytics collection temporarily

**If RabbitMQ is down:**
- Queue critical events in database table
- Background job processes them when RabbitMQ recovers
- Log errors for monitoring

**If SignalR fails:**
- Gracefully degrade to polling
- Frontend falls back to periodic API calls

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
```csharp
services.AddHttpClient("redis")
    .AddPolicyHandler(Policy
        .Handle<Exception>()
        .CircuitBreakerAsync(5, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)));
```
